					<h2>Trajectory calculation </h2>
					<p> At the time of World War II intelligent bombs were not 
						yet developed, so ground based artillery was used to 
						attack the enemy. Depending on the distance of the 
						target and the type of artillery, the bullet has to be 
						shoot in a certain angle. This angle also is related to 
						the weather, especially to the wind. To know the 
						correct angle in the specific situation, the artillery 
						men used so-called firing tables. But those firing 
						tables had to be computed first. </p>
					<p> Those ballistic computations were done at the Moore 
						School of Electrical Engineering, part of the 
						University of Pennsylvania, too.</p>
					<p class="cite">Calculating a trajectory could take up to 
						40 hours using a desk-top calculator. The same problem 
						took 30 minutes or so on the Moore School's 
						differential analyzer. But the School had only one such 
						machine, and since each firing table involved hundreds 
						of trajectories it might still take the better part of 
						a month to complete just one table. <a 
						href="#references" class="references">[1]</a></p>
					<p> The speed up in developing new artillery designs caused 
						an increased need of computation power. In November 
						1942 US forces landed in French North Africa, and 
						entered a terrain, which was entirely different from 
						what they had met before. The existing firing tables 
						turned out as completely useless. That made the 
						computation power totally to the bottleneck of the war 
						machinery. </p>

					<p> Under these circumstances John Mauchly, a member of 
						Moore School's <i>Engineering, Science, and Management 
						War Training</i> (ESMWT) program, wrote a first 
						five-page memo called <i>The Use of Vacuum Tube Devices 
						in Calculating</i>. In this paper he suggested a 
						machine that would add 5,000 10-digit numbers per 
						second and would be more than 100 times faster than the 
						fastest computer at that time (the fastest computer in 
						1942 was a mechanical relay computer operating at 
						Harvard, Bell Laboratories with 15-50 additions per 
						second <a href="#references" 
						class="references">[1]</a>).</p>
					<h2> Speed up through vacuum tubes </h2>
					<p> The memo was followed by two proposals, which Mauchly 
						wrote together with J. Presper Eckert, Jr., an 
						instructor at Moore School. In June, 1942, a contract 
						was signed and the project became funded by the United 
						States Army. The machine to be developed was named 
						<i>Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer</i>, 
						short <i>ENIAC</i>. </p>
					<p> The ENIAC's great innovation was the usage of vacuum 
						tubes for number representation in contrast to 
						mechanical relays, which were commonly used at that 
						time. The machine consists out of forty independent 
						panels, each 0.6 m wide, 2.7 m high and 0.7 m deep plus 
						three movable function tables. Those units were 
						<i>arranged in U shape occupying an area of about 10m 
						by 17m</i> <a href="#references" 
						class="references">[2]</a>. The total number of 17,468 
						vacuum tubes were used. The first demonstration of the 
						ENIAC's computing power could be given two years 
						later:</p>
					<p class="cite"> In May of 1944, the ENIAC team was able to 
						demonstrate ENIAC's workability in what has come to be 
						known as the two accumulator test. In this, one 
						accumulator was made to increment its value from one to 
						five. The number was then transferred into the second 
						unit one thousand times using the limited control 
						circuitry housed in each accumulator, all in just over 
						one fifth of a second, or about the blink of the eye. 
						At the end of the test, the second accumulator sat 
						idle, displaying the number 5,000 &ndash; hardly the 
						most impressive of mathematical feats. <a 
						href="#references" class="references">[1]</a></p>
					<p> One problem to deal with was the reliability of the 
						vacuum tubes. For frequently used circuits the tubes 
						were selected by hands, and special test procedures 
						were implemented to identify a broken tube within 
						minutes in case of a failure. This happened about two 
						or three times a week causing a weekly downtime of only 
						a few hours. </p>
					<h2>Programming the ENIAC</h2>
					<p>The ENIAC didn't have a memory to store programs. So 
						programming the ENIAC means physically connecting the 
						units by cables and turning switches to the appropriate 
						settings. This work was done by six women whose jobs 
						were called computers. They were chosen from a group of 
						over eighty women that were calculating ballistic 
						trajectories by hand. </p>
					<p class="img"> <img src="history2.jpeg" 
						alt="View of the ENIAC in its U-shaped room" /> 
						<br/>The first professional programmers (US Army photo)</p>
					<p> 20 of the ENIAC's 40 units were Accumulators. An 
						Accumulator was capable to store a 10-digit number, to 
						add and to subtract. Other arithmetic units were the 
						Multiplier, supported by the Function Table, and the 
						Divider/Square-rooter. For fast number input, the 
						Constant Transmitter was used, whereas for controlling 
						the program flow a Master Programmer was helpful. The 
						IO connection to stored data was done by an IBM card 
						reader and an IBM card punch controlled by a printer 
						panel. Finally there were the Cycling unit as pulse 
						machine and the Initiating unit to boot the whole 
						machine or to start a program. </p>
					<p> In May 1945, yet before the ENIAC was formally 
						completed, the World War II came to its end. That 
						meant, the initial aim of computing firing tables for 
						the artillery became obsolete. But the upcoming cold 
						war required even more complex computations. So <i>the 
						first real task assigned to ENIAC during its test runs 
						in 1945 involved millions of discrete calculations 
						associated with top-secret studies of thermonuclear 
						chain reactions &ndash; the hydrogen bomb. <a
